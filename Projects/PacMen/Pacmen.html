            <p class="lead my-3">In this assignment, we were instructed to create a Pacman factory using the hints and
                images we were given. It was a
                struggle for me to fully figure it out but after a little time, it came together. To use the Pacman
                factory just click
                add Pacman for the amount you want, then click start game to make them start moving. Each time you press
                start game they
                will go faster.</p>
