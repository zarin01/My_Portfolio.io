# My Portfolio

Hello my name is Zarin Neugebauer, and this is my portfolio!
I am a student at MIT xPRO coding bootcamp and so far I have learned alot. This portfolio shows what I have learned.


# Layout/Description

Once you click on the link to the website you will see a page with an animation and a video with me describing what I have learned and how I created the website.

NEXT you will see an about me with an image and a quick bio

AFTER you will see cards with some of the projects I have worked on. Hover over each card to see the button to each project's page. Each page includes a title and a description on how to run the code and how it was made. Under that will be a link to the Github Repository.

# How To Run

To run this website just click on the link I have on the right side of the screen or HERE https://zarin01.github.io/My_Portfolio.io/ Once you are on the website you will be able to go through and see all the projects I have made and my bio. Everything runs on the website so you will not need a code editor!

# Road Map

I plan to add a lot more projects in the future including more pages so I can show the notes I have created while being in class!
